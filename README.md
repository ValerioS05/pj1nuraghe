## Here is a Practical way to explain what my idea was at the beginning
![screenshot of what was my idea at the beginning for desktop and tablets](/assets/images/screendesk.png)

- `screenshots` : used balsamic to help myself to get an initial idea and how to approach the development




## Structure:
 - The site starting from the index to finish with the signup page find a simple structure from top to bottom ,very linear with loads of content for the mobile version.
In the desktop/tablet I focused more on the media where you can find immersive pictures, a more enlarged structure for the other pages to get a better look on details, without loosing the overall original structure from the index page.
- **The home page**
- We start with the header that is there all the time with you.
  Very clear logo Black on Light gray same as the Nav bar.
  I choose the header to follow your scrolling due to lenght of the website, gives you the chance to arrive at the bottom and change your position even from there.
  The header stays the same in every page, the only element that changes is the nav bar that specifies in which main page you are at the moment.
- The hero image that i choose is coloful didn't distrupt the site's colors it added some contrast. 
  the image is also followed from 2 headers , these 2 headers serves as guidance to the topic of the site and also add interest at the hero image.
- The main content finds 2 pictures, the first at the top the second at the bottom giving a bit of breathing space  between the content
- An article the gives vibes of official and trustfully site.
- The famous sites section gives you the chance to discover more on the site with the option to choose 3 different links.
- The footer contains links to social media and copyright.
  Also the footer keeps same style as header to give consistency to the site and it stays the same for any of the pages.

**Famous sites pages**
-  I used a picture as first look with a timeline and a content respectively from left to right.
- The timeline is different when changing from the tree different directories `losa.html/nuraxi.html/sarbana.html` giving you the feeling of a interactive site.
  The timeline with the content for mobile screen changes position from row to column giving you the same result but saving much space.


**Facts page**
- In the fact page we can see a Video as first look.The video is completly muted and no autoplay. Is well rounded and clear with controls and credits
- I used a list of 10 facts 5 that where most researched over google search engine and 5 that I liked, giving the sense of a personal site but also `what people need`.

**Conctact Page**
- Here we can find a form page only, I opted for a heavy style to supply the fact that the initial form looked very light and tasteless.
  The form got a rocky background same as the timeline to stay consistent with topic and UI.
  We have first part of the form with basic first and last name ,mail and textarea. Giving the user the chance to interact even in a simple page.
 The second part we can see a select dropdown menu where we can choose which kind of subscription you would like but it`s not required.






**Palette**
- I used a gradient of greys all over the pages, from white to black but mainly grey. Even a dull gray give the feeling to stay in contact with these ancient "rocks".
- used [Paletton](https://paletton.com)
## Responsive
- The site is changing at different sizes despite having only 1 media query it is pretty responsive for any kind of device.

**Issues over deployment**

- The first issue was the images that i used, obviously for a content site we need details and even if the pictures got resized the dimension was too big.
- `solution` wrapped the picture in a styled box for larger screens giving a touch of style without loosing much details. Also giving breathing space to dont overwhelm the user
- The second issue was the colors, I tried using different colors and palettes but nothing seemed to fit the monochromatic monuments.
- `solution` I opted for a gradient of grey giving the site a feeling of professional and clear consistent with the meaning of the topic and opted for colorful pictures to give a break to the site palette.
- The third issue was on the form page, at the start looked very empty and kinda useless to the site.
- `solution` Added in some more style than other pages to create some feelings out of a form. Also i changed the second part of the form from a radio to a select box with a dropdown subscription.
