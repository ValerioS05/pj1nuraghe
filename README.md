[Nuraghe`s] is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Simply navigate to the website URL to start exploring. Here are some key features and functionalities:


- **Palette:** I used a gradient of greys all over the pages, from white to black but mainly grey. Even a dull gray give the feeling to stay in contact with these ancient rocks.
- **structure:** The site starting from the index to finish with the signup page find a simple structure from top to bottom ,very linear with loads of content for the mobile version.
In the desktop I focused more on the media where you can find immersive pictures, a more enlarged structure for the other pages to get a better look on details, without loosing the overall original structure from the index page.
