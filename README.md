# [Nuraghe's]

Welcome to [Nuraghe's]! This repository hosts the source code and content for my historical website. Here, we aim to provide a rich and immersive experience for exploring and learning about the ancient structure of Sardinia well known as Nuraghe

## Getting Started
**Explore the Code:** Familiarize yourself with the structure of the codebase. The main files and directories you'll be working with include:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point to the website.
- `assets`: Directory containing CSS stylesheets,and medias like images and video.
- `losa.html`: Directory containing content about a specific argument.
- `nuraxi.html`: Directory containing content about a specific argument.
- `sarbana.html`: Directory containing content about a specific argument.
- `README.md`: This README file for guidance.
- `signup.html`: Directory for Form signup section

## Here a Practical way to explain what my idea was at the beginning

[Nuraghe`s] is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Simply navigate to the website URL to start exploring. Here are some key features and functionalities:

- **Timeline:** Explore historical events through a simple timeline.
- **Resources:** Educational resources related to the historical period.
- **Medias:** Find detailed images and video related to the ancient monuments. 
pictures and video taken from wikimedia commons.
- **Palette:** I used a gradient of greys all over the pages, from white to black but mainly grey.
- **strategy:** Target audience is students, history enthusiasts, academics, or the general public in search of a smart holiday!
- **structure:** The site starting from the index to finish with the signup page find a simple structure from top to bottom ,very linear with loads of content for the mobile version.
In the desktop I focused more on the media where you can find immersive pictures, a more enlarged structure for the other pages to get a better look on details, without loosing the overall original structure from the index page.
