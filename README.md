## Here is a Practical way to explain what my idea was at the beginning
![screenshot of what was my idea at the beginning for desktop and tablets](assets/images/screendesk.png)
![screenshot of what was my idea at the beginning for mobile](./assets/images/screenmobile.png)

- `screenshots` : used balsamic to help myself to get an initial idea and how to approach the development



## Palette:
- I used a gradient of greys all over the pages, from white to black but mainly grey. Even a dull gray give the feeling to stay in contact with these ancient "rocks".
## Structure:
 - The site starting from the index to finish with the signup page find a simple structure from top to bottom ,very linear with loads of content for the mobile version.
In the desktop/tablet I focused more on the media where you can find immersive pictures, a more enlarged structure for the other pages to get a better look on details, without loosing the overall original structure from the index page.




## Responsive
- The site is changing at different sizes despite having only 1 media query it is pretty responsive for any kind of device.
