                    <p>
                        Nuraghes are ancient megalithic structures unique to the island of Sardinia, Italy. These
                        impressive stone towers are emblematic of the Nuragic civilization, which flourished on the
                        island from the Bronze Age (around 18th century BCE) until the Roman conquest in the 2nd century
                        CE.
                        Function: The exact purpose of nuraghes remains a subject of debate among archaeologists, but
                        they are believed to have served multiple functions. These include defensive structures used for
                        protection against invaders or rival groups, residential dwellings for the local population, and
                        possibly ceremonial or religious sites.

                            "Protonuraghe" is a term used in the field of archaeology to refer to a type of early
                            nuraghe structure found in Sardinia, Italy. The prefix "pro-" in "protonuraghe" indicates
                            that these structures are considered precursors or predecessors to the more elaborate
                            nuraghe towers that are characteristic of the Nuragic civilization.
                            <br>
                            Protonuraghe structures are generally simpler in construction compared to later nuraghes.
                            They often consist of a single tower or a basic stone structure, lacking the complexity and
                            defensive features seen in later nuraghes. Protonuraghe sites may also include associated
                            features such as enclosures, walls, or other architectural elements.
                            <br>
                            Archaeological evidence suggests that protonuraghe structures emerged during the Early
                            Bronze Age (around the 18th to 16th centuries BCE) and gradually evolved into the more
                            sophisticated nuraghe towers that are iconic of the Nuragic civilization. These early
                            structures played a significant role in the development of Nuragic architecture and society.
                            <br>
                            The study of protonuraghe sites provides valuable insights into the origins and early stages
                            of the Nuragic civilization, shedding light on the architectural techniques, social
                            organization, and cultural practices of ancient Sardinia. These sites are important for
                            understanding the transition from simpler forms of settlement to the more complex fortified
                            structures that characterized later periods of Nuragic civilization.

                        <dd>The main differences between a "protonuraghe" and a "classic nuraghe" lie in their
                            architectural complexity, size, and defensive features. Here's a breakdown of the key
                            distinctions:
                            <br>
                            Architectural Complexity: Protonuraghes are generally simpler in design compared to classic
                            nuraghes. Protonuraghes often consist of a single tower or basic stone structure, whereas
                            classic nuraghes are more elaborate, featuring multiple towers, interconnected rooms,
                            courtyards, and additional defensive walls or structures.
                            <br>
                            Size: Classic nuraghes tend to be larger in size compared to protonuraghes. While
                            protonuraghes may be relatively small and compact, classic nuraghes can range in size from
                            medium to large, with some towers reaching heights of up to 20 meters (65 feet) or more.
                            <br>
                            Defensive Features: Classic nuraghes typically exhibit more advanced defensive architecture
                            compared to protonuraghes. Classic nuraghes often have thicker walls, narrower entrances,
                            and more complex layouts designed to enhance their defensive capabilities. They may also
                            include additional defensive features such as bastions, guard chambers, and secondary
                            towers.
                            <br>
                            Development Stage: Protonuraghes are considered precursors or early stages in the
                            development of nuraghe architecture. They emerged during the Early Bronze Age and gradually
                            evolved into the more sophisticated classic nuraghes that are characteristic of the later
                            phases of the Nuragic civilization.
                            <br>
                            Chronology: Protonuraghes are generally older than classic nuraghes, dating back to the
                            Early Bronze Age (around the 18th to 16th centuries BCE), while classic nuraghes were
                            constructed during later periods of the Bronze Age and Iron Age, spanning from the 15th
                            century BCE to the 2nd century CE.
