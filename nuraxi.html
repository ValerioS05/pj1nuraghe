                        Su Nuraxi was abandoned in the 6th century B.C. although intermittent occupation took place
                        in
                        subsequent centuries.
                        People continued to live on the site until the 3rd century.

                            The Su Nuraxi nuraghe consisted of a massive central tower of three chambers connected
                            by a
                            spiral staircase,
                            originally over 18.5 metres high. The uppermost chamber is no longer standing.
                            The central tower was enclosed within a quadrilobate structure consisting of four
                            subsidiary
                            towers
                            linked by a massive stone curtain wall.
                            The courtyard created by this wall was later sealed with a roof thereby restricting
                            access
                            to
                            the central tower. Surrounding this are the remains of second outer wall and a
                            settlement of
                            circular huts.
                            <br>
                            The property has a high level of authenticity. Although intermittently used until the 6th or
                            7th century CE, the nuragic structures appear to have been buried since then until
                            archaeological excavations commenced in the 1950s. A systematic conservation campaign was
                            undertaken in the early 1990s to stabilise and reinforce a number of structures. Subsequent
                            restoration and consolidation works on the structures were undertaken in full compliance
                            with the Restoration Charter, thus ensuring their conservation to the present day.
